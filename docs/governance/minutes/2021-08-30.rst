2021 Annual Budget Update
-------------------------

In January, we approved our budget for the year, which totaled **$271.48** .
Since we have 9 advisors for this year, the dues totaled $30.17 per advisor although we are waiting to see if new members join the board which could lower the per person due amount.
Thank you to everyone for paying your dues on time!

-  In our January meeting, it was noted that if someone had something they’d like to add to the budget, we could put it to a vote the next semester.
-  We will likely have a little extra since a large portion of the stickers cost was intended for PyCon stickers.
-  The Treasurer, Edwin, provided an update that we needed to approve the budget.
-  The group discussed and decided removing stickers from the 2021 budget due to COVID-19 and the lack of in person events (previously cost $133.50 and paid for by Rebecca.  Thank you Rebecca!)
-  The board decided to reallocate this sticker money towards buying small thank you gifts for developers who make significant contributions to Yellowbrick.
-  *Ben suggested that we add an additional item to the budget* Add cost for gifts to Reviews and Contributors* - such as coffee and a YB branded T-Shirt. This is to show the YB spirit of Gratitude.  A budget of $750.  We have two potential sponsors (detailed below)

- Proposal 2 lines of budget: Board gifts 8 of us - Create budget $320 External Funding, External Gifts paid for partly by board dues/external funding:

  1. We voted to split these 2 lines items into separate voted - Unanimously Support
  2. Vote only external funding for Board gifts - Unanimously supported
  3. Vote to remove Sticker budget and put back into budget for external gifts - Unanimously supported
  4. Vote to remove Nathan from Board Roster

Yellowbrick v1.3 Status Updates/Milestone Planning
---------------------------------------------------

Status Update:
The issues that are part of this milestone can be found [here:] (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/milestone/16)

Milestone planning:

- We need to ensure 0.24 Scikit-Learn Compatibility (Scipy 1.6 issues) * to help deal with this * pip sklearn dependency 0.23 (current)
- We need to research PEP517 and how to implement “pip install -e .” See how python is now dealing with python packaging.

Ideas for next Administrative Projects:

  1.)  Release a User Survey on Twitter

  2.)  Content Marketing through Twitter

  3.)  Prema to review backlog

Member Topics

- Kristen suggested exploring incorporating pip dependency resolver:In its January release (21.0), pip will use the new dependency resolver by default. The
  documentation gives a good overview of the new changes and guidance on how to respond to the new ResolutionImpossible error message.
- Kristen recommended replacing the iris dataset with other datasets in ours documentation.
- Changes to sklearn.utils for Sklearn Private/Public addressed in API [PR 1138] (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/pull/1138)
